I developed a cutting-edge hotel booking platform that focuses on last-minute bookings while offering a user-friendly experience for both urgent and regular reservations. The platform features a highly advanced algorithm I designed that dynamically searches and filters hotels with available rooms within a specified range from the user's location, ensuring fast and relevant results.

 <span className=" text-lg font-semibold">Key Features:</span>
Last-Minute Booking Algorithm: The core of the platform is an advanced algorithm that scans and identifies hotels with available rooms in real-time, adjusting for user preferences such as proximity, price range, and room type.
Location-Based Search: Using Google Maps API, the platform automatically detects the user's location and suggests hotels within a customizable distance, making it perfect for spontaneous travelers.
Comprehensive Filters: Users can fine-tune their hotel search with a variety of advanced filters, including:
Price Range: Filter hotels based on budget or premium options.
Room Type: Choose between suites, single rooms, or family accommodations.
Amenities: Select hotels with specific amenities such as Wi-Fi, pools, gyms, or pet-friendly rooms.
Rating & Reviews: Filter hotels based on user reviews and star ratings to ensure quality stays.
Hotel Chains: Filter by popular hotel chains or boutique options.
Cancellation Policy: Find hotels with flexible cancellation options for added peace of mind.
Booking Flexibility: In addition to last-minute booking features, the website supports standard hotel booking processes with check-in/check-out dates, payment options, and customer service integration.
Real-Time Availability: Integrated Redis caching and real-time database updates for seamless booking experience with minimal latency.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed a clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS to ensure an easy-to-navigate experience across all devices.
Payment Integration: Secure payment processing through Stripe to handle instant bookings and reservations.
Cloud Hosting: Deployed the platform on AWS for scalability, security, and high availability, ensuring that the platform can handle spikes in traffic, especially during peak travel seasons.
